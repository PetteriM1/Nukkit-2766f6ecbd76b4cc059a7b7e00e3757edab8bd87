# Nukkit PetteriM1 Edition

### What is Nukkit PM1E? ###
Nukkit PM1E, also known as Nukkit PetteriM1 Edition is a specialised version of the [Nukkit](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Nukkit) Minecraft Bedrock Edition server software, used on the server [SuomiCraft PE](http://suomicraftpe.tk/).

This software boasts many key features over the standard Nukkit, including, **extensive multiversion support**, **frequent releases** and updates and **native support for mobs**.


### How to install Nukkit PM1E: ###
1. Obtain the .jar from the CircleCI or Google Drive (these can be found in "Releases") and put it in a folder.

2. On *Windows* systems, create a Start.cmd file and inside put the text: `java -jar [release name].jar`, or navigate to the directory via PowerShell and run the jar. On *Linux, BSD or MacOS* systems, use `cd [path/to/the/jar]` to enter the directory of the executable and run: `$ java -jar [release name].jar`.

3. Join the server using the private IP to play locally, this can be found with `ipconfig` in CMD prompt, or by connecting to `127.0.0.1` in the game. If you have issues with connecting as a localhost, launch Windows PowerShell as an administrator and run the following: `CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe"`.

>KEY NOTE: Java 8 or above is required to run Nukkit PM1E, java 11 is recommended.
