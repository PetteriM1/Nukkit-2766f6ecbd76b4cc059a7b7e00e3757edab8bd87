# Nukkit PetteriM1 Edition
This is a special version of [Nukkit](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Nukkit) Minecraft Bedrock Edition server software made for my server [SuomiCraft PE](http://suomicraftpe.tk/).

####How to install Nukkit PM1E:
1. Obtain the .jar from the Jenkins or Google Drive (these can be found in "Releases") and put it in a folder.
2. On *Windows* systems, create a Start.cmd file and inside put the text: `java -jar [release name].jar`
 On *Linux, BSD or MacOS* systems, use `cd [path/to/the/jar]` to enter the directory of the executable and run: `$ java -jar [release name].jar`
3. Join the server using the private IP (if you waht to play locally), this can be achieved with `ipconfig` in CMD prompt. If youhave issues with connecting as a localhost, look here: https://pmmp.readthedocs.io/en/rtfd/faq/connecting/win10localhostcantconnect.html

>KEY NOTE: Java/JRE must be installed in order to run the executable.
